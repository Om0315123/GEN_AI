# HOW DOES AI WORK ?

❓WHAT IS GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE ? <br>
➡️ Simply speaking , Gen AI is a system that creates new content (text, images, videos, etc.) based on prompts and large language models (LLMs).
<br>
<br>
❓What is LLM and how are they trained ? <br>
➡️ It’s a type of artificial intelligence trained on huge amounts of text (books, websites, articles, chats, etc.).
<br>
➡️Language models are a key part of AI that help computers understand and generate human language.
<br>
➡️LLMs are trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and can generate content through it. NLP is a branch of machine learning that teaches computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
<br>
<br>
Some popular LLMs include: <br>
- OpenAI's GPT-4 <br>
- Anthropic's Claude<br>
- Google's Gemini

# NLTK ( NATURAL LANGUAGE TOOLKIT )
 👉 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) specializes in NLP tasks such as text generation, spell check, and translation.
 <br>
 👉 Python comes with many libraries that make work with language models easier. One of the most used libraries for AI is the nltk library.
 ## let's set up our Python environment with the NLTK
  - Create a new .py Python file. <br>
  - Install the nltk and numpy libraries. <br>
